Keep laptops and phones out of the bedroom at night.) Set aside time (daily, if possible) for meditation. Practice deep breathing techniques like box breathing  breathe in for four counts, hold your breath for four counts, breathe out for four counts and hold again for four. Repeat this three or four times. Exercise Try a yoga class. You can go to a local studio, take online classes, or find free ones on YouTube. Increase the amount you move during the day.

Enjoy your food and eat when you are calm, instead of stressed or angry, for good digestion. Eat your biggest meal at lunch when your digestion is best.

                "Ayurvedic Lifestyle If you have only used Western medicine, ayurveda may sound exotic. If youre not ready to visit an ayurvedic practitioner for a consultation, there are many simple ayurvedic practices you can do at home to help balance your mental, physical, and spiritual health. For sleep/stress relief Try keeping a regular sleep/wake schedule and adopting better sleep hygiene. (Keep your bedroom quiet, at a comfortable temperature, and dark at bedtime. Keep laptops and phones out of the bedroom at night.) Set aside time (daily, if possible) for meditation. Practice deep breathing techniques like box breathing  breathe in for four counts, hold your breath for four counts, breathe out for four counts and hold again for four. Repeat this three or four times. Exercise Try a yoga class. You can go to a local studio, take online classes, or find free ones on YouTube. Increase the amount you move during the day. Listen to your body  maybe you need a long, slow walk one day and a brisk run another. Ayurvedic food Eat fresh, homemade food instead of processed products. Enjoy your food and eat when you are calm, instead of stressed or angry, for good digestion. Eat your biggest meal at lunch when your digestion is best. This may also help you sleep at night if you aren't trying to digest a heavy dinner. Focus on foods that balance all of the doshas, including fruits, vegetables, rice, nuts, and honey as a sweetener."

                "Rasa, roughly corresponds to 'taste' in English. Ayurvedic pharmacology has the concept that helps exploring and verifying pharmacological behavior of a substance based on its rasa. Rasa is quite larger a concept than taste, where taste is only the first tool to enter into a larger concept. Rasa is defined as a 'knowledge perceived through Rasan\u0101 Indriya (roughly gustatory sensation) located at Jihv\u0101 (tongue).' Caraka says rasa is experienced the moment a substance comes into contact with the tongue. Caraka further states that the clearly perceived knowledge is only the rasa of the substance. Any other perception like those which happen afterwards or mildly are termed anurasa (a sequel to the main rasa). In Ayurveda, rasa has not been limited to the sensory knowledge through the taste buds but it has also been attributed certain actions which can be linked to the 'flavors' experienced by means of retronasal olfaction and chemesthesis irritation. Thus, 'rasa' refers to a complex totality of experience arising from all the perceptory interactions of the material with sensors in the mouth and nasal passages, taste buds, olfactory and chemesthetic receptors. Caraka goes on to state that the rasa can be different in fresh condition and dry form of the same substance. Further, the same substance having different rasa in fresh and dry condition have different pharmacological properties in those conditions. For example, Piper longum Linn. is Madhura in fresh condition, whereas in dry form it is Katu and accordingly fresh P. longum is heavier to digest (guru) than dry P. longum which is easy to digest (laghu). Therefore, it is obvious that since rasa indicates the pharmacological behavior of the substance as and when the substance is presented before the user, rasa can be used as a tool to test the substance in use."

                "Term Rasa in Ayurveda signifies many things. Most commonly it is understood on the physical level where it points towards the sense of taste perceived by the sense organ tongue. On the mental level it is the good and bad experiences we have in our lives for e.g. a favorable experience is sweet. Good and bad memories and experiences are often referred to as sweet and bitter respectively. Sweet experiences are nourishing for the mind as well as the body while bitter ones have the opposite effect. Spiritually speaking \u2018Atma rasa\u2019 where \u2018Atma\u2019 signifies our soul is a stage where one is in union with one\u2019s soul. This union is a state of ecstasy. This stage is beyond the perception of mind hence it is not bitter or sweet but always neutral. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and spiritual well being. Hence \u2018rasa\u2019 so vividly described in Ayurveda is the basis of health."
